    During a MySQL session, one can lock tables in two modes: automatic

    statement execution, and all acquired locks are stored in 'lock'
    member. Unlocking takes place automatically as well, when the
    statement ends.
    Manual mode comes into play when a user issues a 'LOCK TABLES'
    statement. In this mode the user can only use the locked tables.
    Trying to use any other tables will give an error. The locked tables are
    stored in 'locked_tables' member.  Manual locking is described in
    the 'LOCK_TABLES' chapter of the MySQL manual.
    See also lock_tables() for details.
